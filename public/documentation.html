    <h1>Movie API</h1>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>
        Once completed, this application will allow users to retrieve data about movies, as well data about directors and actors/actresses.
        The application will allow users to sort through the available data elements to find movies that meet criteria that they will be able to input (for example, users will be able to sort movies by genre).
        Users will also be able to create lists of their favorite movies, or movies that they would like to watch. The styling of the application will also be improved so it looks more appealing than a word document =)

        Currently, this project used Node.js and Express to create a web server that listens to HTTP requests on port 8080. User's can enter the following URLs to access the application's different pages: 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">http://localhost:8080/</a> - This opens the welcome page</li>
            <li><a href="/index.html">http://localhost:8080/index.html</a> - This open's the application's Home Page</li>
            <li><a href="#">http://localhost:8080/documentation</a> - This opens the application's documentation page (The one you are viewing now!)</li>
            <li><a href="/movies">http://localhost:8080/movies</a> - This opens an array containing JSON objects for my favorite movies from the 2025 Oscars. Each object includes the title of the movie and the director.</li>
        </ul>
