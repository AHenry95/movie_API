    <p>
        Once completed, this application will allow users to retrieve data about movies, as well data about directors and actors/actresses.
        The application will allow users to sort through the available data elements to find movies that meet criteria that they will be able to input (for example, users will be able to sort movies by genre).
        Users will also be able to create lists of their favorite movies, or movies that they would like to watch.
